# Student Management System 

The Student Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage student records.

This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a database through a console based interface.

- Search a student : Search for a student by ID
- Update student details : Manipulate the existing student information.
- Delete a student : Remove a student's record from the database.

## Database Setup
