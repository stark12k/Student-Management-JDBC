# Student Management System 

## Student Management System Using JDBC:

The Student Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage student records. The application uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interact with relational databases for storing, retrieving, and managing student data efficiently. This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a database through a console based interface.

## Features

-> Add a new Student : Insert new student records into the database.
-> View all students : Fetch and display all student records.
-> Search a student : Search for a student by ID
-> Update student details : Manipulate the existing student information.
-> Delete a student : Remove a student's record from the database.
